--- abstract

This document creates an IANA registry for the PCAP and PCAPNG LINKTYPE values.
The PCAP and PCAPNG formats are used to save network captures from programs such as tcpdump and wireshark, when using libraries such as libpcap.

--- middle

# Introduction

In the late 1980's, Van Jacobson, Steve McCanne, and others at the
Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
developed the tcpdump program to capture and dissect network traces.
The code to capture traffic, using low-level mechanisms in various
operating systems, and to read and write network traces to a file was
later put into a library named libpcap.

Other documents describe the original (legacy) format used by tcpdump (pcap), as well as the revised format (pcapng) which is used by tcpdump and wireshark.

Within those formats each packet that is captured is described by a LINKTYPE value.
The LINKTYPE value selects one of many hundred formats for meta data and layer 2 encapsulation of the packet.

This document creates a registry for the LINKTYPE format, establishing the IANA
Considerations by which other uses of the pcap and pcapng formats may register new
formats.

#  IANA Considerations

## LinkType Registry {#linktype}

IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "The PCAP Registry".

IANA is also requested to create a subregistry entitled "PCAP LinkType List" under that registry. The LinkType registry is a table of 16-bit numbers. The policy allocation {{RFC8126}} for this subregistry is as follows:

* Values from 0 to 32767 must be allocated via Specification Required.

* Values from 32768 to 65000 are allocated following a First-Come First-Served policy.

* Values from 65001 to 65535 are reserved for Private Use.

The Registry has four columns: the symbolic name (LINKTYPE_something),
the integer value, a very short description, and the document/requester
reference.

The initial version of the registry is provided in the table below.  In each
case here, the reference should be to
http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html, which is not repeated each time.

The initial value of table is base upon the Link type list maintained by
libpcap, and published on the tcpdump.org web site as
http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html.

Note that historically, values were assigned incrementally on First-Come/First-Served basis, with a preference for a public specification, but with no mandate.
Some historical values may have less specification than desired.

LinkType values 147 to 162 named LINKTYPE\_RESERVED\_xx were originally reserved for Private Use.  Their use is Deprecated in favour of the values above 65001.

In general, Private Use values should never leak out of the entity that uses it.
As the First-Come First-Served allocation is large and easily obtained, official values are recommended.

There is often an associated DLT value which are often identical in
value, but not universally so.
DLT values are associated with specific operation system captures, and are operating system specific, and are thus not subject to standardization.
