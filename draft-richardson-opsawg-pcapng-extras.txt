1.  Introduction to Additional Block Types

   TBD

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Additional Block Types

3.1.  systemd Journal Export Block

   The systemd (https://systemd.io/) Journal Export Block
   (https://systemd.io/JOURNAL_EXPORT_FORMATS/) is a lightweight
   container for systemd Journal Export Format entry data.

   One of the primary components of the systemd System and Service
   Manager is the "Journal", a message logging system that uses arrays
   of key-value pairs.  Journal entries are stored in a database-like
   file on disk but can be serialized to easily parseable "Journal
   Export Format" data or to a JSON object.  The block described here is
   limited to Journal Export Format data only.

   A systemd Journal Export Block contains a single systemd Journal
   Export Format entry.  Each entry MUST contain a __REALTIME_TIMESTAMP=
   field.  If a timestamp for the block is required it can be derived
   from this field.  Each entry MUST be zero-padded to 32 bits.
   Although the primary use of this block is intended for importing data
   from systemd, it could potentially be used to include arbitrary key-
   value data in a capture file.

   Figure 1 shows the format of the Journal Export Block.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 1: systemd Journal Export Block Format

   The systemd Journal Export Block has the following fields:

   *  Block Type: The block type of the Journal Export Block is 9.

   *  Block Total Length: total size of this block, as described in
      [I-D.tuexen-opsawg-pcapng], section "Section Blocks".

   *  Journal Entry: A journal entry as described in the Journal Export
      Format (https://systemd.io/JOURNAL_EXPORT_FORMATS/) documentation.
      Entries consist of a series of field names followed by text or
      binary field data.  Common field names can be found in the
      systemd.journal-fields
      (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-
      fields.html) documentation.  The __REALTIME_TIMESTAMP= field MUST
      be present and valid as described above.  Entries are not
      guaranteed to be a multiple of four octets and must be zero-
      padded.  This allows the length of the entry to be determined by
      finding the last non-zero octet in the Journal Entry data.  An
      entry may contain an entry separator (trailing newline) as
      described in the Journal Export Format specification

3.2.  Alternative Packet Blocks (experimental)

   Can some other packet blocks (besides the ones described in the
   previous paragraphs) be useful?

3.3.  Compression Block (experimental)

   The Compression Block is optional.  A file can contain an arbitrary
   number of these blocks.  A Compression Block, as the name says, is
   used to store compressed data.  Its format is shown in Figure 2.

                           1                   2                   3

      /                                                               /
      /  variable length, octet-aligned and padded to end on a 32-bit /
      /                         boundary                              /
      /                                                               /

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: Compression Block Format

   The fields have the following meaning:

   *  Block Type: The block type of the Compression Block is not yet
      assigned.

   *  Block Total Length: total size of this block, as described in
      [I-D.tuexen-opsawg-pcapng], section "Section Blocks".

   *  Compression Type (8 bits): an unsigned value that specifies the
      compression algorithm.  Possible values for this field are 0
      (uncompressed), 1 (Lempel-Ziv), 2 (Gzip), other?? Probably some
      kind of dumb and fast compression algorithm could be effective
      with some types of traffic (for example web), but which?

   *  Compressed Data: data of this block.  Once decompressed, it is
      made of other blocks.

3.4.  Encryption Block (experimental)

   The Encryption Block is optional.  A file can contain an arbitrary
   number of these blocks.  An Encryption Block is used to store
   encrypted data.  Its format is shown in Figure 3.

                           1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                               /

      /                       Encrypted Data                          /
      /                                                               /
      /                 variable length, octet-aligned                /
      /                                                               /

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 3: Encryption Block Format

   The fields have the following meaning:

   *  Block Type: The block type of the Encryption Block is not yet
      assigned.

   *  Block Total Length: total size of this block, as described in
      [I-D.tuexen-opsawg-pcapng], section "Section Blocks".

   *  Encryption Type (8 bits): an unsigned value that specifies the
      encryption algorithm.  Possible values for this field are ???
      (TODO) NOTE: this block should probably contain other fields,
      depending on the encryption algorithm.  To be defined precisely.

   *  Encrypted Data: data of this block.  Once decrypted, it originates
      other blocks.

3.5.  Fixed Length Block (experimental)

   The Fixed Length Block is optional.  A file can contain an arbitrary
   number of these blocks.  A Fixed Length Block can be used to optimize
   the access to the file.  Its format is shown in Figure 4.  A Fixed
   Length Block stores records with constant size.  It contains a set of
   Blocks (normally Enhanced Packet Blocks or Simple Packet Blocks), of
   which it specifies the size.  Knowing this size a priori helps to
   scan the file and to load some portions of it without truncating a
   block, and is particularly useful with cell-based networks like ATM.

                    Figure 4: Fixed Length Block Format

   The fields have the following meaning:

   *  Block Type: The block type of the Fixed Length Block is not yet
      assigned.

   *  Block Total Length: total size of this block, as described in
      [I-D.tuexen-opsawg-pcapng], section "Section Blocks".

   *  Cell size (16 bits): an unsigned value that indicates the size of
      the blocks contained in the data field.

   *  Fixed Size Data: data of this block.

3.6.  Directory Block (experimental)

   If present, this block contains the following information:

   *  number of indexed packets (N)

   *  table with position and length of any indexed packet (N entries)

   A directory block MUST be followed by at least N packets, otherwise
   it MUST be considered invalid.  It can be used to efficiently load
   portions of the file to memory and to support operations on memory
   mapped files.  This block can be added by tools like network
   analyzers as a consequence of file processing.

3.7.  Traffic Statistics and Monitoring Blocks (experimental)

   One or more blocks could be defined to contain network statistics or
   traffic monitoring information.  They could be use to store data
   collected from RMON or Netflow probes, or from other network
   monitoring tools.

3.8.  Event/Security Block (experimental)

   This block could be used to store events.  Events could contain
   generic information (for example network load over 50%, server
   down...) or security alerts.  An event could be:

   *  skipped, if the application doesn't know how to do with it

   *  processed independently by the packets.  In other words, the
      applications skips the packets and processes only the alerts

   *  processed in relation to packets: for example, a security tool
      could load only the packets of the file that are near a security
      alert; a monitoring tool could skip the packets captured while the
      server was down.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

   [Open issue: decide whether the block types, option types, NRB Record
   types, etc. should be IANA registries.  And if so, what the IANA
   policy for each should be (see RFC 5226)]
