                     draft-ietf-opsawg-pcap-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the format used by the libpcap library to
   record captured packets to a file.  Programs using the libpcap
   library to read and write those files, and thus reading and writing
   files in that format, include tcpdump.

1.  Introduction

   In the late 1980's, Van Jacobson, Steve McCanne, and others at the
   Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
   developed the tcpdump program to capture and dissect network traces.
   The code to capture traffic, using low-level mechanisms in various
   operating systems, and to read and write network traces to a file was
   later put into a library named libpcap.

   This document describes the format used by tcpdump, and other
   programs using libpcap, to read and write network traces.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  General File Structure

   A capture file begins with a File Header, followed by zero or more
   Packet Records, one per packet.

   All fields in the File Header and in the headers of Packet Records
   will always be written according to the characteristics (little
   endian / big endian) of the machine that is writing the file.  This
   refers to all the fields that are written as numbers and that span
   over two or more octets.

   The approach of having the file written in the native format of the
   host writing the file is more efficient because it avoids translation
   of data when writing the file or reading the file on the host that
   wrote the file, which is the most common case when generating or
   processing capture captures.

4.  File Header

   The File Header has the following format, with the octet offset of
   fields shown to the left of the field:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     0 |                          Magic Number                         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     4 |          Major Version        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     6 |          Minor Version        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     8 |                           Reserved1                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    12 |                           Reserved2                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    16 |                            SnapLen                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    20 |               LinkType and additional information             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 1: File Header

   The File Header length is 24 octets.

   The meaning of the fields in the File Header is:

   Magic Number (32 bits):  an unsigned magic number, whose value is
      either the hexadecimal number 0xA1B2C3D4 or the hexadecimal number
      0xA1B23C4D.

      If the value is 0xA1B2C3D4, timestamps in Packet Records (see
      Figure 3) are in seconds and microseconds; if it is 0xA1B23C4D,
      timestamps in Packet Records are in seconds and nanoseconds.

      These numbers can be used to distinguish sessions that have been
      written on little-endian machines from the ones written on big-
      endian machines, and to heuristically identify pcap files.

   Major Version (16 bits):  an unsigned value, giving the number of the
      current major version of the format.  The value for the current
      version of the format is 2.  This value should change if the
      format changes in such a way that code that reads the new format
      could not read the old format (i.e., code to read both formats
      would have to check the version number and use different code
      paths for the two formats) and code that reads the old format
      could not read the new format.

   Minor Version (16 bits):  an unsigned value, giving the number of the
      current minor version of the format.  The value is for the current
      version of the format is 4.  This value should change if the
      format changes in such a way that code that reads the new format
      could read the old format without checking the version number but
      code that reads the old format could not read all files in the new
      format.

   Reserved1 (32 bits):  not used - SHOULD be filled with 0 by pcap file
      writers, and MUST be ignored by pcap file readers.  This value was
      documented by some older implementations as "gmt to local
      correction" or "time zone offset".  Some older pcap file writers
      stored non-zero values in this field.

   Reserved2 (32 bits):  not used - SHOULD be filled with 0 by pcap file
      writers, and MUST be ignored by pcap file readers.  This value was
      documented by some older implementations as "accuracy of
      timestamps".  Some older pcap file writers stored non-zero values
      in this field.

   SnapLen (32 bits):  an unsigned value indicating the maximum number
      of octets captured from each packet.  The portion of each packet
      that exceeds this value will not be stored in the file.  This
      value MUST NOT be zero; if no limit was specified, the value
      SHOULD be a number greater than or equal to the largest packet
      length in the file.

   LinkType and additional information (32 bits):  a 32-bit unsigned
      value that contains the link-layer type of packets in the file and
      may contain additional information.

   The LinkType and additional information field is in the form

                            1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |FCS len|R|P|     Reserved3     |        Link-layer type        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

             Figure 2: LinkType and additional information

   The field is shown as if it were in the byte order of the host
   reading or writing the file, with bit 0 being the most-significant
   bit of the field and bit 31 being the least-significant bit of the
   field.

   Link-layer type (16 bits):  a 16-bit value indicating link-layer type
      for packets in the file; it is a value as defined in the PCAP
      LinkType list registry, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-pcaplinktype].

   Reserved3 (10 bits):  not used - MUST be set to zero by pcap writers,
      and MUST NOT be interpreted by pcap readers; a reader SHOULD treat
      a non-zero value as an error.

   P (1 bit):  a bit that, if set, indicates that the Frame Check
      Sequence (FCS) length value is present and, if not set, indicates
      that the FCS value is not present.

   R (1 bit):  not used - MUST be set to zero by pcap writers, and MUST
      NOT be interpreted by pcap readers; a reader SHOULD treat a non-
      zero value as an error.

   FCS len (4 bits):  a 4-bit unsigned value indicating the number of
      16-bit (2-octet) words of FCS that are appended to each packet, if
      the P bit is set; if the P bit is not set, and the FCS length is
      not indicated by the link-layer type value, the FCS length is
      unknown.  The valid values of the FCS len field are between 0 and
      15; Ethernet, for example, would have an FCS length value of 2,
      corresponding to a 4-octet FCS.

5.  Packet Record

   A Packet Record is the standard container for storing the packets
   coming from the network.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     0 |                      Timestamp (Seconds)                      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     4 |            Timestamp (Microseconds or nanoseconds)            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     8 |                    Captured Packet Length                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    12 |                    Original Packet Length                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    16 /                                                               /
       /                          Packet Data                          /
       /                  variable length, not padded                  /
       /                                                               /

                        Figure 3: Packet Record

   The Packet Record begins with a 16-octet header, followed by data
   from the packet.

   The meaning of the fields in the Packet Record is:

   Timestamp (Seconds) and Timestamp (Microseconds or nanoseconds):  sec
      onds and fraction of a seconds values of a timestamp.

      The seconds value is a 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the
      number of seconds that have elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,
      and the microseconds or nanoseconds value is a 32-bit unsigned
      value that represents the number of microseconds or nanoseconds
      that have elapsed since that seconds.

      The Magic Number field in the File Header of a file indicates
      whether the values of the Timestamp (Microseconds or nanoseconds)
      fields of packets in that file are in units of microseconds or
      nanoseconds.

   Captured Packet Length (32 bits):  an unsigned value that indicates
      the number of octets captured from the packet (i.e., the length of
      the Packet Data field).  It will be the minimum value among the
      Original Packet Length and the snapshot length for the interface
      (SnapLen, defined in Figure 1).

   Original Packet Length (32 bits):  an unsigned value that indicates
      the number of octets of packet data that would have been provided
      had the packet not been truncated to the snapshot length for the
      interface or to a length limit imposed by the capture mechanism.
      If no truncation was done, it will be the same as the Captured
      Packet Length, but it will be different from the Captured Packet
      Length if the packet has been truncated by the capture process.
      It SHOULD NOT be less than the Captured Packet Length.

      A pcap file writer MAY write an Original Packet Length that is
      less than the Captured Packet Length if both the Captured Packet
      Length and the Original Packet length came from a file in which a
      packet had an Original Packet Length less than the Captured Packet
      Length; otherwise, it MUST write an Original Packet Length that is
      greater than or equal to the Captured Packet Length.

      A pcap file reader MAY convert an Original Packet Length that is
      less than the Captured Packet Length to a value that is greater
      than or equal to the Captured Packet Length.

   Packet Data:  the data coming from the network, including link-layer
      headers.  The actual length of this field is the Captured Packet
      Length.  The format of the link-layer headers depends on the
      LinkType field specified in the file header (see Figure 1) and it
      is specified in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-pcaplinktype].

   Packet Records are not padded to a 4-octet boundary; if the number of
   octets of packet data is not a multiple of 4, there are no padding
   octets following it, so Packet Records are not guaranteed to begin on
   a 4-octet boundary within a file.

6.  Recommended File Name Extension: .pcap

   The recommended file name extension for the "PCAP Capture File
   Format" specified in this document is ".pcap".

   On Windows and macOS, files are distinguished by an extension to
   their filename.  Such an extension is technically not actually
   required, as applications should be able to automatically detect the
   pcap file format through the Magic Number field in the File Header,
   as some desktop environments other than those of Windows and macOS
   do.  However, using name extensions makes it easier to work with
   files (e.g. visually distinguish file formats) so it is recommended -
   though not required - to use .pcap as the name extension for files
   following this specification.

   Please note: To avoid confusion (such as the current usage of .cap
   for a plethora of different capture file formats) file name
   extensions other than .pcap should be avoided.

   There is new work to create the PCAP Next Generation capture File
   Format (see [I-D.ietf-opsawg-pcapng]).  The new file format is not
   compatible with this specification, but many programs read both
   transparently.  Files of that type will start with a Section Header
   Block, the first four octets of which are 0x0A 0x0D 0x0D 0x0A, which
   does not match any of the Magic Number values in a pcap File Header,
   allowing code that reads both file formats to determine the format of
   a file.

7.  Security Considerations

   A pcap file reader MUST do invalid header and packet checks.  It can
   receive as input not only valid headers or packets, but any arbitrary
   random sequence of octets: Headers or packets originally malformed by
   the sender or by a fuzz tester, corrupted in transit or for some
   other reason.
